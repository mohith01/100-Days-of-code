  <summary>709 cpp Explained</summary>
  <p>
    We are incrementing s[i] with the numeric value of s[i - 1].
For example: s = "a2"
we are replacing s[1] with s[0] + numeric value (s[i - 1]).
To calculate numeric value of a character we just subtract ASCII value of '0'.
'0' - '0' = 0(int) and '5' - '0' = 5(int)
a + '2' - '0' = a + 2 = c ('a' ASCII value is 97 then 97 + 2 = 99 which is ASCII value of c and the conversion is done implicitly by the compiler)
so result is "ac"
